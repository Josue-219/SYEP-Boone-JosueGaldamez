    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="color:red">My name is Josue Galdamez and I am Salvadorian. Im going to become a junior in highschool. I deem myself to be a team player. 
      This first started when I used to play soccer as a kid and played on teams. This dedication and team alliance grew with me. 
      In school I could talk to anyone, which led to my varsity baseball expirience as a freshmen. I feel as I am a thinker, I try to think outside the box in everything and find ways to fix everything no matter how small. Going back to dedication, I like to finish what I start. A prime example is this website. In the future I want to go to trade school and work in a trade, either plumbing or electrician due to my familys roots in trades. Also with how in demand it is and the need for it. As well as it not be easily replaced with AI.  </p>

Their mission is to give acess to the opportunities to kids who are leaders and ready to start they're journy to theyre carrear. Students go through 10 weeks of classes and emerge in proferssional skills and networking with real life professionals. They work on a project with fellow studenst from other schools based on set topic given and pitch their ideas at JP Morgan firm in Manhatten to real professionals in office building.
